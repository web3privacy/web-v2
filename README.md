# Web3Privacy Now Website (V2)

This document outlines the vision and principles for the second generation (V2) of the official Web3Privacy Now (W3PN) organizational website.

The V2 website is designed from the ground up to be our organization's primary home. Its purpose is to clearly answer the questions: "Who are we?", "What have we accomplished?", and "How can you join our mission?".

While the [Web3 Privacy Portal](https://github.com/web3privacy/portal) serves the wider ecosystem as a public library, this site is a direct reflection of our impact and an invitation to get involved with our work.

### Guiding Principles for V2

*   **Clarity & Purpose:** The website must be straightforward and easy to navigate. Every page will have a clear, strategic goal.
*   **Show, Don't Just Tell:** We will prove our value by building a comprehensive portfolio of our completed work, not just describing our plans.
*   **Community First:** The people behind the mission are our greatest asset. The site will be designed to celebrate, recognize, and empower our team and community contributors.

### Core Features of V2

The V2 website will be built around several key features designed to showcase our organization's impact and create clear engagement funnels:

*   🏆 **Project Portfolio:** A dedicated, linkable page for every project we undertake, detailing its goals, process, and measurable outcomes.
*   💡 **Content:** A curated showcase of our most impactful content. This includes our original research, articles, videos, and conference talks that establish our thought leadership.
*   👥 **Our Community:** Profiles of our members and a dynamic space to recognize the active contributors who drive our success.
*   🤝 **Partners & Supporters:** Acknowledging the vital organizations and individuals who collaborate with us and make our work possible.
*   🚀 **Get Involved:** Clear, simple, and welcoming pathways for new people to join our teams and contribute their skills.
*   ❤️ **Support Our Mission:** Easy and transparent ways for anyone to provide financial support for our ongoing work and infrastructure.
